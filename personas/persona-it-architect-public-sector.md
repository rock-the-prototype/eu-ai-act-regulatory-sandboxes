## Role and institutional context

Sascha Block works as an IT architect at Mobil Krankenkasse, which operates as a corporation under public law within the German statutory health insurance system.

As a public-law institution, Mobil Krankenkasse is subject to specific legal, regulatory, and accountability obligations. Its digital systems are part of the public healthcare infrastructure with a mandate to serve the public interest.

Within this institutional setting, Sascha Block operates in the domain of the German telematic infrastructure (TI), which is increasingly aligned with the development of an interoperable European digital health infrastructure.

## Domain context: German Telematics Infrastructure (Telematikinfrastruktur, TI)

The German Telematics Infrastructure forms the backbone of critical digital health services such as the electronic patient record (ePA), electronic prescriptions (eRezept), and related applications that directly affect healthcare delivery, data protection, and public trust.

IT Architectural decisions in this domain are made under conditions of:
- high regulatory density,
- strict security and privacy requirements,
- and long-term operational responsibility.

Failures or design flaws do not remain local but can have systemic effects across healthcare providers, insurers, and patients.

## Core conviction: **health protection** and **data protection** are mutually reinforcing principles.

A central conviction shaping this perspective is that **health protection and data protection must not be played against each other**.
Health protection and data protection reinforce each other when designed as part of a coherent digital architecture.

Meaningful digital health infrastructure requires both:
- robust protection of sensitive personal data, and
- the responsible use of data to improve medical treatment, healthcare outcomes, and scientific research.

A constructive and factual dialogue about digital health therefore includes potential risks as well as the concrete benefits of systems such as the ePA — for patients, healthcare professionals, and society as a whole.

## Value of data in the public healthcare infrastructure

From this perspective, the value of the ePA and related TI services lies in their potential to:
- support better and more individualised medical treatment,
- reduce information asymmetries in healthcare processes,
- and enable research that can improve public health outcomes when data is used under clear, lawful, and transparent conditions.

Discussing these benefits openly is considered an essential part of responsible digital governance in a public-law context.

## System sustainability and public responsibility

A further key concern is the long-term financial and structural sustainability of the German healthcare system.

The system is widely recognised as financially constrained and structurally complex. In this context, resilience and sustainability depend not on isolated optimisation, but on deliberate coordination where it matters most.

Redundancy remains a fundamental principle for reliability, failover, and risk mitigation. At the same time, experience shows that for system-critical components, long-term value is created when they are jointly designed, planned, and hardened, rather than developed in uncoordinated parallel implementations of functionally identical solutions.

Digital identities provide a clear example. Initiatives such as the future EUDI Wallet demonstrate how trust, security, and interoperability can be strengthened when core components are approached as shared digital infrastructure with a high level of protection and common governance.

This perspective applies equally to other foundational components of public digital infrastructure, where shared thinking, coordinated implementation, and collective hardening support efficient use of limited resources while increasing overall system robustness.


As a corporation under public law, the use of public resources creates a heightened responsibility to:
- avoid unnecessary duplication,
- reduce fragmentation,
- and ensure that publicly financed digital assets contribute to shared digital infrastructure.

---

## Public goods versus black-box solutions

A critical observation in the context of publicly funded digital health infrastructure is the tendency for involved actors, when acting as software vendors, to deliver closed, black-box solutions while protecting proprietary assets.

From this perspective, such approaches conflict with the idea of publicly financed digital components as **digital public goods**.

**Transparency**, **auditability**, and **interoperability** are therefore prerequisites for trust, security, and long-term viability in public-law systems.

## Implications for AI regulatory sandboxes

From this explicitly named, public-law perspective, AI regulatory sandboxes are relevant insofar as they:
- enable early validation of security, privacy, and interoperability assumptions,
- reduce regulatory and operational uncertainty before large-scale deployment,
- and support architectural decisions that affect critical public healthcare infrastructure.

Their primary value lies not in experimentation for its own sake, but in preventing irreversible design errors in systems that must operate reliably at national scale and under public responsibility.
