# Persona: Sascha Block — Founder & Managing Director, Private Sector (INZTITUT GmbH)

I translate the EU AI Act’s regulatory sandbox intent into implementable, interoperable architecture and evidence patterns — designed for large-scale, cross-organisation rollout.

## Primary objectives 
- Role: Standards & Interoperability Architect, Creator of Rock the Prototype - Prototyping & Software development
- Mission: Strengthen common good outcomes by reducing fragmentation and enabling portability across organisations and Member States.
- Values: interoperability, transparency of obligations, vendor neutrality.
- Focus: Author and Lead architect of [dsl-core](https://github.com/rock-the-prototype/dsl-core) — an open, formal standard specification for defining software requirements in a deterministic, machine-readable, Git-versioned and audit-ready way, enabling systematic verification of implementations in regulated and trustworthy digital systems.

  I work on an open, formal standard that enables software requirements to be defined in a revision-safe, machine-readable, versioned and auditable form — so trustworthy digitalisation becomes verifiable, not interpretive.

  *DSL Core* is an *open standards specification* to define requirements formally, deterministically and traceably over time. By versioning requirements in Git and making them explicit and testable, DSL Core provides a normative basis against which implementations can be systematically verified.

  Goal:
  I develop a domain-specific language (DSL) that:
  * is human- and machine-readable (e.g., JSON or simple text form),
  * represents syntactically unambiguous, verifiable requirements (AFOs),
  * is testable and versionable (Git integration),
  * can be automatically validated and audited (CI/CD),
  * and can express semantic governance rules, exclusions, negative rules, etc.


## Why this perspective is relevant for the EU AI Act
- The EU AI Act is a large-scale regulatory system by design: many actors, many domains, many implementations.
- Regulatory sandboxes and large-scale pilots only scale if interfaces, artefacts, and evidence are portable across organisations.
- Therefore, the practical question is: what is the minimum interoperable baseline that makes outcomes repeatable and production-relevant?

## Focus in this repository
- Turn sandbox obligations into operational requirements, controls, and evidence artefacts.
- Define portability: which artefacts must be reusable across authorities and programmes.
- Specify maturity gates: measurable exit criteria from sandbox → production.
- Keep contributions vendor-neutral: outcomes and interfaces over tool choices.

## Typical questions I ask
- What must be provable for sandbox results to be accepted as production-relevant?
- Which artefacts are authoritative (plan, logs, test reports, incident handling, oversight records)?
- Where does oversight become operational (monitoring, escalation, post-market feedback loops)?
- What is the minimum interoperability baseline that avoids fragmentation?

## Outputs / artefacts 
- Mapping tables: regulatory text → operational requirement → control → test → evidence
- Interoperability baseline checklist (data, APIs, identity/access, logging, reporting)
- Reference architecture templates (roles, components, interfaces, evidence flows)
- Maturity gates with measurable exit criteria (sandbox phases → production readiness)
