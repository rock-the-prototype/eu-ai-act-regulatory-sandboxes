# Common requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes

This document outlines a set of common requirements that are relevant across different sectors, organisational contexts, and stakeholder perspectives. The requirements are derived from practical experience in regulated digital environments and are intended to support the objectives of AI regulatory sandboxes as defined in Regulation (EU) 2024/1689.

They are formulated in a neutral and descriptive manner and do not constitute normative demands.

## Interoperability

AI regulatory sandboxes involve multiple actors, systems, and jurisdictions. Interoperability is therefore a foundational characteristic.

Sandbox environments benefit from clear assumptions regarding:
- technical and organisational interfaces,
- compatibility with existing standards and infrastructures,
- and the ability to transfer insights beyond a single sandbox instance.

Interoperability supports comparability of outcomes and enables regulatory learning across organisational and national boundaries.

## Production relevance

The usefulness of AI regulatory sandboxes depends on their relationship to later production environments.

Sandbox configurations that differ substantially from operational conditions limit the transferability of technical, security, and compliance-related findings. A sufficient degree of production relevance supports realistic assessment of risks, costs, and architectural implications prior to market deployment.

## Data governance

AI regulatory sandboxes involve multiple actors, systems, and regulatory layers. In practice, they frequently relate to use cases involving sensitive or otherwise regulated data. Clear data governance is therefore essential.

Relevant aspects include:
- clarity on data sources and permitted uses,
- traceability of data flows,
- and alignment with existing legal obligations.

Addressing data governance at the sandbox stage supports legal certainty and trust among participants.

## Security-by-design baseline

Security considerations are integral to sandbox environments, particularly in regulated or high-impact domains.

A shared security-by-design baseline provides a reference for:
- protecting systems and data during sandbox operation,
- ensuring consistency with broader risk management practices,
- and enabling meaningful assessment of residual risks.

Such a baseline does not prescribe specific technologies but establishes common principles and expectations.

## Versioning and auditability

AI regulatory sandboxes are dynamic environments. Configurations, assumptions, and rules may evolve over time.

Versioning and auditability support:
- traceability of changes,
- reproducibility of findings,
- and transparency towards oversight bodies and stakeholders.

These characteristics contribute to regulatory learning beyond isolated experimentation phases.

## Purpose of this document

The common requirements described above serve as a shared reference point for discussing the design and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes.

They are intended to complement procedural rules by highlighting structural and operational characteristics that support comparability, transferability, and long-term learning across sandbox initiatives.
