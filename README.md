Structured analysis and governance-oriented feedback on EU AI Act regulatory sandboxes, focusing on interoperability, operationalisation and production-grade prototyping.

# *EU AI Act – Regulatory Sandboxes*

This repository provides a **structured, governance-oriented analysis of the draft implementing act on AI regulatory sandboxes under the EU AI Act**.

Its purpose is to contribute to the ongoing policy discussion by examining how regulatory sandboxes can effectively support innovation **while remaining interoperable, secure, and production-relevant** in highly regulated environments.

The content is based on practical experience in large-scale digital infrastructure, public-sector IT, and software architecture, with a particular focus on:
- interoperability across organisational and national boundaries,
- operationalisation beyond isolated pilot environments,
- and production-grade prototyping as a prerequisite for security, compliance, and investment certainty.

Rather than treating regulatory sandboxes as experimental playgrounds, this repository approaches them as **learning infrastructures** that should reduce fragmentation, enable regulatory learning, and create reliable transition paths from experimentation to real-world deployment.

The repository is intentionally maintained in a transparent and versioned manner to reflect the iterative nature of both software development and modern regulation.

## Context: EU Commission consultation

This repository relates to the European Commission’s targeted stakeholder consultation on the draft implementing act for AI regulatory sandboxes under the EU AI Act. The consultation page provides the official background, scope, and submission details:

[Commission seeks feedback on draft implementing act to establish AI regulatory sandboxes under AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/consultations/commission-seeks-feedback-draft-implementing-act-establish-ai-regulatory-sandboxes-under-ai-act)

*“The Commission is collecting feedback on the rules to set for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes as mandated by the AI Act.

The AI Act offers the possibility for (prospective) providers to develop, train, validate and test their innovative AI system for a limited time under regulatory supervision in a controlled framework set up by a competent authority. This can also be done where appropriate in real-world conditions.

AI regulatory sandboxes will support the objective of the AI Act to foster AI innovation and support compliance with the AI Act. The Commission will adopt an implementing act to set out the common rules for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes as mandated by the AI Act.”*
