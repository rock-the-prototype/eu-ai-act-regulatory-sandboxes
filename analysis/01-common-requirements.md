# Common requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes

This document outlines a set of **common, cross-cutting requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes under the EU AI Act**.  
The requirements are derived from *practical experience* in *regulated digital infrastructures* and are intended to provide a neutral reference baseline before considering specific stakeholder perspectives or detailed assessments of the draft implementing act.

The focus is on structural and operational characteristics that enable regulatory sandboxes to function as effective learning environments while remaining compatible with later real-world deployment.

## Interoperability

AI regulatory sandboxes operate at the intersection of multiple organisations, sectors, and national contexts. Interoperability is therefore a foundational characteristic rather than an optional feature.

From a technical and organisational perspective, sandbox environments benefit from:
- clearly defined interfaces between participating systems and organisations,
- the ability to integrate with existing digital infrastructures and standards,
- and consistent handling of data, identity, and access across organisational boundaries.

Interoperability supports comparability of results, reduces fragmentation, and enables insights gained in sandbox environments to remain transferable beyond a single authority or pilot context.

## Production parity

The value of a regulatory sandbox is closely linked to its relationship with later production environments.  
Sandbox setups that differ significantly from real-world operational conditions risk limiting the applicability of technical, security, and compliance-related findings.

Production parity refers to the degree to which relevant architectural, operational, and security characteristics of a sandbox environment reflect those of a future production environment. This includes, for example:
- deployment and runtime characteristics,
- identity and access management concepts,
- logging and monitoring approaches,
- and operational responsibilities across involved parties.

A sufficient level of production parity supports realistic testing, informed investment decisions, and reliable transition paths from experimentation to deployment.

## Data governance (including unlearning)

Regulatory sandboxes frequently involve the processing of data under controlled conditions.  
Clear data governance is therefore essential to ensure legal certainty, transparency, and trust among participants.

Relevant aspects of data governance in sandbox contexts include:
- clarity on data sources and permitted uses,
- rules for data ingestion, retention, and deletion,
- traceability of data flows within the sandbox,
- and mechanisms to reflect changes in legal or factual conditions.

In the context of AI systems, data governance also encompasses considerations around the reversibility of learning effects, including the ability to address situations where previously used data must no longer influence system behaviour (“unlearning”). Addressing such aspects at the sandbox stage supports regulatory learning and reduces downstream uncertainty.

## Security-by-design baseline

Security considerations are integral to the design and operation of regulatory sandboxes, particularly in regulated or safety-critical domains.

A security-by-design baseline provides a shared reference for:
- protecting systems and data during sandbox operation,
- ensuring consistency with broader security and risk management practices,
- and enabling meaningful assessment of residual risks.

Such a baseline does not prescribe specific technologies but establishes a common understanding of minimum security principles and controls relevant to sandbox activities.

## Versioned and auditable sandbox baseline

Regulatory sandboxes are dynamic by nature. Configurations, rules, and assumptions evolve over time as learning progresses.

Maintaining a versioned and auditable sandbox baseline supports:
- traceability of changes to technical and organisational setups,
- reproducibility of findings and decisions,
- and transparency towards participating stakeholders and oversight bodies.

Versioning and auditability enable regulatory learning to be documented explicitly and make it possible to relate outcomes to specific configurations, timeframes, and assumptions rather than treating sandbox results as isolated snapshots.

## Purpose of this baseline

The common requirements described above are intended to serve as a neutral reference point.  
They are not specific to individual stakeholders or use cases and do not constitute an evaluation of the draft implementing act.

Subsequent documents may build on this baseline to analyse alignment with the draft implementing act or to discuss implications from different stakeholder perspectives.
